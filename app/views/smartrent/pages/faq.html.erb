          I have been renting at a <%= link_to "Bozzuto managed community", find_apartments_path %> for some time and it offers the SmartRent program. What happens to those funds?

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          A: As a Bozzuto SmartRent community resident, you automatically accrue funds. 
          Once you activate your online account on this website with the e-mail address used on your lease,
          you can view your accumulated funds in your SmartRent profile.
          You are eligible to use these funds towards the purchase of a new <%= link_to "Bozzuto Home", find_a_new_home_path %> after 12 consecutive months 
          of occupancy at a participating Bozzuto managed apartment community.

      <div class="question">
        <p>Can I use my SmartRent funds as earnest money when I sign my new home sales contract?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          No. SmartRent funds are credited to the purchaser at the time of Deposit/Settlement and can be applied towards closing costs 
          or to reduce your monthly payments. They do not replace the required earnest money deposit funds at time of contract 
          or interim deposits due during the purchase process. 
          Please consult with the sales manager at the <%= link_to "Bozzuto Homes", find_a_new_home_path %> community of your choice for details.
