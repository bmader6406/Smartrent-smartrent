           You can also go to <%= link_to "Find a SmartRent Apartment", find_apartments_path %> at any time to find the list of participating communities, or feel free to check with your Property Manager.  If a community is Bozzuto owned (or the owner has opted in) and is located in the DMV area, it will be a part of the SmartRent program.

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
         Yes. However, SmartRent funds cannot be used with the purchase of a moderately priced home (MPDU) as provided through various county programs. Some communities (Uplands in Baltimore, MD) will allow a 50% SmartRent credit usage due to the partnership with Baltimore City which lowers purchase prices.
