      <h3>Earn money towards a new Bozzuto home when you rent with a Bozzuto managed rental property.</h3>

      <p>
        When you rent from a Bozzuto SmartRent apartment community, 
        you earn a *$350 dollar credit every month while living in most participating 
        Bozzuto managed apartments - up to a total of $10,000 - to help you purchase a new condominium,
        townhome or single-family home from Bozzuto. Simple as that. 
        No gimmicks. Best of all, no cost to you. 
        Your rent will stay the same, whether you choose to use your SmartRent credits or not.

      <p>
        Because you’re already living with us, you won’t need a realtor when you buy your Bozzuto home.
        However if you chose to use a realtor, you may apply up to 50% of your SmartRent credit.

        The credits will be ready to use as soon as you close on your new home.
