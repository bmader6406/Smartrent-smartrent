      With the Bozzuto SmartRent program, purchasing a brand <%= link_to "new home" ,'https://www.bozzuto.com/new-homes/communities', target: :_blank %> is well within reach. Each month that you rent from a Bozzuto participating property, you'll earn a $350 contribution, for a maximum of $10,000, towards the purchase of a brand new <%= link_to "Bozzuto Home",'https://www.bozzuto.com/new-homes/communities', target: :_blank %>. Simple as that. Bozzuto SmartRent credits are applied towards the out-of-pocket costs associated with building a new home, helping to jump start your savings plan. Best of all, there's no cost to you and enrollment is automatic.
