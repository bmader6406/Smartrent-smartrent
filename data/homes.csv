<p>
<strong>Imagine designing the perfect place to live. Think beyond the four walls of your home. What would the ideal village be like? </strong>What makes for a well-lived life? We believe its a community of good friends and neighbors, and a place where you belong, from the very first moment and for years to come.</p>
<p>
This is the art of the village, building the ideal life from the ground up. More than three centuries ago, Richard Shipley named his farm here ""Adam the First."" Over the years, it has remained a working farm, tied to the land and rooted in tradition. Today, the very best of village living has been carefully preserved at Shipley's Grant.  Everything has been considered, chosen and designed for artful living.  From the native Maryland plants used for our landscaping to the stone and brick faces of our homes, to the streets made for walking, to the pool built for friendships.  If there is an art to living well, it resides here - at Shipley's Grant.</p>
